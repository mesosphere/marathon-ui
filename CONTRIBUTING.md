#### Found an Issue?
If you find a bug in the source code or a mistake in the documentation, you can
help by submitting an issue to the [Marathon GitHub Repository](https://github.com/mesosphere/marathon/issues).

#### Submitting an Issue
Before you submit your issue search the archive, maybe your question was already answered.

**IMPORTANT**: please use the label `gui` when submitting issues related to the
`marathon-ui`.

#### Compiling the UI

1. Install [NPM](https://npmjs.org/)

2. Install dev dependencies

        npm install
        npm install -g gulp

3. Run development environment

        npm run serve

4. Build the assets

        npm run dist

    Or create a webjar

        npm run deploy

#### Adding npm package dependencies to package.json

If you want to add a new npm package to 'node_modules':

1. Install the new package

        npm install [your package] --save
    will install and save to dependencies in package.json and

        npm install [your package] --save-dev
    will add it to devDependencies.

2. Create a synced npm-shrinkwrap.json with devDependencies included

        npm shrinkwrap --dev

#### <a name="guidelines"></a> Coding Guidelines

There is an ```.editorconfig```-file to apply editor settings on various editors.

##### Sublime Text specific configuration

1. Add the following to your Sublime Text User Settings:

  ```json
  {
    ...
    "rulers": [80], // lines no longer than 80 chars
    "tab_size": 2, // use two spaces for indentation
    "translate_tabs_to_spaces": true, // use spaces for indentation
    "ensure_newline_at_eof_on_save": true, // add newline on save
    "trim_trailing_white_space_on_save": true, // trim trailing white space on save
    "default_line_ending": "unix"
  }
  ```

2. Add Sublime-linter with eslint:

  1. Installing SublimeLinter is straightforward using Sublime Package Manager, see [instructions](http://sublimelinter.readthedocs.org/en/latest/installation.html#installing-via-pc)
  2. Follow the instructions for [SublimeLinter-eslint](https://github.com/roadhump/SublimeLinter-eslint)


#### Submitting a Pull Request
Before you submit your pull request consider the following guidelines:

* Search [GitHub](https://github.com/mesosphere/marathon-ui/pulls) for an open or closed Pull Request
  that relates to your submission. You don't want to duplicate effort.
* Make your changes in a new git branch:

     ```shell
     git checkout -b my-fix-branch master
     ```

* Create your patch, including [appropriate test cases](#testing)

* Follow our [Coding Guidelines](#guidelines)

* Commit your changes using a descriptive commit message

* Build your changes locally to ensure all the tests pass:

    ```shell
    npm run dist
    ```

* Push your branch to GitHub:

    ```shell
    git push origin my-fix-branch
    ```

* In GitHub, send a pull request to `marathon-ui:master`.

* If we suggest changes then:
  * Make the required updates.
  * Re-run the test suite to ensure tests are still passing.
  * If necessary, rebase your branch and force push to your GitHub repository (this will update your Pull Request):

    ```shell
    git rebase master -i
    git push origin my-fix-branch -f
    ```

That's it! Thank you for your contribution!

#### <a name="testing"></a> Testing approach

Use the [BDD style](http://guide.agilealliance.org/guide/bdd.html) of testing.
Tests should be organised around scenarios rather than rigidly around class
structure and method names, for example "Creating an application" rather than
"Application#initialize". Test for correct error handling as well as correct
behaviour. Mock where necessary, but not as a matter of course.

Keep tests short, clean, and descriptive. Aim for high code coverage, but don't
worry about achieving 100% coverage. Try to keep tests flexible. Test the
interface, not the implementation.

Aim to ensure that tests run quickly to keep the feedback loop tight.
