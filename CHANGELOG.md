- \#1673 - Prerequisites to deploy a webjar via TeamCity
  * In a production environment, the API will be requested by ../v2/ instead of

    be generated on-the-fly.

## 0.10.0 - 2015-07-10
### Added
- \#1754 - UI: Allow administratively zeroing / resetting the taskLaunchDelay
  * The App list now displays two additional possible statuses: "Delayed" and
    "Waiting". The "Delayed" status also displays a tooltip showing
    the remaining time until the next launch attempt.
  * The App page now allows the user to reset the task launch delay for a
    "Delayed" app, thus forcing a new immediate launch attempt.

### Changed
- The Backbone router was replaced by the react-router in order to remove the
  jQuery and Backbone dependency completely.
  Routes have changed to include a leading slash, e.g.:
  ```#apps``` is now reachable under ```#/apps```.
  Modal dialogs are now part of the URL via query strings,
  e.g. ```#/apps?modal=about```, so the underlying page is not lost on refresh.

### Removed
- The static name field in the about/info modal got removed. It's reflected by
  the framework name field.

  Ajax-wrapper.
